A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements **1** unit to the left

### function description:

I decided to use ruby for this challenge for the agility and the numorous method that it has
for array's manipulation.

rotLeft has the following parameters

1. An array of integers **a**
2. An integer **d** the number of rotation

- **output format**

Print a single line of **n** space-separated integers denoting the final state of the array after performing **d** left rotations

- what to expect

```a = [1,2,3,4,5]
     rotLeft(a, 2)
     returned arr = [3,4,5,1,2]
```
